Sorry, I need to work on this some more...

PREREQUISITES:

 * GHC 6.8 or above             http://www.haskell.org/ghc

Once you have that, you can just run "make".  It will tell you if you
are missing any Haskell libraries.

All remaining packages can be found from http://hackage.haskell.org as
a central location.   Here are some of the packages and their
homepages.  Again, you can use either their homepage or
http://hackage.haskell.org to download them.

 * MissingH 1.0.1 or above      http://software.complete.org/missingh
 * hslogger                     http://software.complete.org/hslogger
